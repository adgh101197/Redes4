Greetings everyone

I want to share with you my thought about plagiarism.

Since we are in primary school, when out teachers ask us to search something 
and write about it but just using your one words. There were de first advices 
about not doing plagiarism.

Sometimes when we are doing research and we find a good quote or a photo about the topic,
 it is ok to use it. It is good and helpful to read other ideas about something to feel 
 inspired to write your own ideas. The important thing is to specified the source or 
 the author you take that from. That is the important issue about plagiarism. You 
 always have to do the references about your resources.

You have to be really helpful with this. A lot of important institutions see the
 plagiarism really bad, and the repercussion is always really bad. Sometimes is just a 
 cero in the homework, and sometimes it is a report in your file about bad behavior. 
 It is not worth it to do it.

Just try to find a good moment and place, to feel inspire about the topic you have to 
write about it or the activities. Remember, it is not bad to use other ideas, just 
always put the references and explain why you use it.
