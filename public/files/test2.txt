Greetings everyone

As always, the topic study in this unit are really helpful to us. In this unit, 
the topics about how to make a good paragraph is really important. Most of the time, 
when you are talking to someone, it’s important to say the right words in the right 
order, to make it interesting.

In other case, like in the school. We have to make reports every time we go to the 
laboratory. So, it is really important to know how and which images, tables, or 
diagrams fit better with the topic. Talking about the description of the activity we 
did in the laboratory, it is also important to make a short paragraph but with the full 
information.

In my case, at work, I have to make a full report for each project. I had to looked for 
formal words, better tables to represent the information. I usually try to write the main 
ideas in one note to organize the topics, and have a better sequence in the report. 
The most important thing about this reports, was that I had to do research about the 
topics, about the results that I had.

Talking about the activity, for my, it was really interesting to do the number 1. 
Sometimes, when I am writing something, I do two things. Either I writhe a really 
long sentences, or sentences with just 3 words. So, in my case it was a challenge 
but really helpful to transform 5 short sentences to 1 good sentences, with the 
right words and information.

I you have any question about the activities, don’t hesitate to contact me

Best regards,
